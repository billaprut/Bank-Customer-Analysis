# Bank-Customer-Analysis

In a comprehensive data analysis project for Terp Savings & Loan Bank in College Park, I utilized Python libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to gain insights from customer data. Key aspects of the analysis included:

1. Credit Limit and Revolving Balance Analysis: Investigated the range of credit limits and total revolving balances, determining the total credit available and the percentage of customers below the average revolving balance.

2. Education Level Analysis: Utilized bar charts to depict the education levels of credit card consumers, revealing significant insights about the bank’s customer base, predominantly graduates and high school degree holders.

3. Gender Equality Assessment: Analyzed gender distribution among customers, concluding a balanced representation of male and female clients, which negated the initial hypothesis of significant gender inequities.

4. Risk Analysis: Examined the average utilization ratio of customers' credit limits, identifying a substantial percentage of clients posing potential risks to the bank’s operations due to under or over-utilization of credit.

5. Income Range Targeting for Ad Campaign: Conducted a histogram analysis to determine the most common income ranges, recommending targeting the 'Less than $40k' segment for the bank's new ad campaign for maximum impact and customer acquisition.

6. Bundling Strategy for Product Usage: Analyzed the number of products used by customers, suggesting a bundling strategy to increase the bank's product usage and profitability.
